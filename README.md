# SecurityToolBox
This is a toolbox that offers different encrypting, hashing, coding, ... functionalities. I used Streamlit for the UI.

To run the app, you need to use the command : streamlit run main.py

The UI is easy to use, with handled exceptions and guiding messages.

We called it HaFa security because the names of the creators are Hanin and Fares.
